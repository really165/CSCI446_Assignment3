### Installation
Three files are needed to use JPL in java, but if you have SWI-prolog installed you already have them and they can be found wherever the folder that swi-prolog was installed into.

### Examples
Prolog queries are done by passing the prolog command as a string into a query object and then checking if it has any solutions.

### What I have
I use the jpl.dll file by making a system variable that points to the bin folder in swipl.
I use the jpl.jar file by adding it to the library list in the project properties in Netbeans.
