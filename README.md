### Installation
Three files are needed to use JPL in java, but if you have SWI-prolog installed you already have them and they can be found wherever the folder that swi-prolog was installed into.

### Examples
Prolog queries are done by passing the prolog command as a string into a query object and then checking if it has any solutions.
